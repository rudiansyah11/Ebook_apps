            <h2>👉 QUESTION: How should I use the Billionaire Brain Wave?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>✅ ANSWER: Listening to the Billionaire Brain Wave is simple, easy and you can do it at-home as soon as today:
                Just download the digital audio track on your phone or computer. All the technology is already programmed into the Track and will start to amplify your hippocampus by increasing your Theta, so there’s nothing you need to “do”.

                Just close your eyes and listen. After 7 minutes, the audio track will finish and you’ll be ready. That’s it.

                You don’t need to meditate, repeat a mantra or write anything down.

                What if you miss a day? No problem, and it’s not the end of the world if you miss it. Just try to listen every day for those 7 minutes.

                The benefits increase each time you listen. The result is a large hippocampus with its amplified Theta wave and all the extraordinary benefits that come with it.

            <h2>👉 QUESTION: Do I need to use headphones while listening to the Billionaire Brain Wave, or the other specially-tuned Digital Audio Tracks?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>✅ ANSWER: Yes. We recommend you listen to the The Billionaire Brain Wave Digital Audio Track with headphones or earpods.

            <h2>👉 QUESTION: How many times per day should I listen to the Billionaire Brain Wave? Will I get more benefits by listening to it more often?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            ✅ ANSWER: You should always aim to listen to the Billionaire Brain Wave Digital Audio Track once per day. That’s what most of the customers who have emailed in their Success Stories did.

                A small minority of customers prefer to listen to the Billionaire Brain Wave Digital Audio Track twice per day, and report this works even better for them. If you’re going to do this, we recommend listening once in the morning, and once again before bed.

                But it’s not required at all. The Billionaire Brain Wave Digital Audio Track was designed to be listened to once per day.

            <h2>👉 QUESTION: If I have the Billionaire Wave Booster, should I only listen to that, or should I still listen to both the main Billionaire BRain Wave and the Billionaire Wave Booster?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                ✅ ANSWER: If you are an Billionaire Wave Booster Customer, the ideal ritual is you listen to the main Billionaire Brain Wave Track once per day,    and the Billionaire Wave Booster Track once per day. Dr. Summers recommends you listen to the main Billionaire Brain Wave Track in the morning, and the Billionaire Brain Wave at night. Listening to them in tandem like this is excellent.

                But if that doesn’t work, you can listen to them at any other time of day, and that is still very, very good.

                And if your life happens to be really busy right now and you only have time for one, you listen only to the Billionaire Wave Booster once per day. Then when you get more time, you can aim to return to listening to both the Billionaire Brain Wave Track in the morning and the Billionaire Wave Booster at night.

            <h2>👉 QUESTION: How fast will I see results from the Billionaire Brain Wave?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>✅ ANSWER:

                Everyone is different. And it really depends on how small your hippocampus and Theta are, on your upbringing and society.

                Generally speaking, many of our clients start to notice a difference, such as clarity about what they have to do, the insight they most want to come to them or even problems that somehow resolve themselves within the first two or three days. Some people even say that they “noticed things improving” in their lives just a few hours after hearing it for the first time.

                Other changes, such as an improvement in finances or weight loss, can occur over time, in the coming weeks and months.

                Remember that your mind is the source of energy that influences every part of your life, so there is no limit to the benefits you can experience when you start operating more in Theta.

                You may find that a difficult problem is solved with little or no effort on your part.

                Or, suddenly, you begin to realize that money appears from everywhere, without you even expecting it.

                As you listen more each day, things change and new skills begin to reveal themselves. You automatically start to think better about your life. You feel a surge of confidence in your quest for incredible health, amazing relationships and an incredible career, as things finally start to fall into place for you.

                And while many of these improvements occur in the first month, the magic will continue as you keep listening to those 7 minutes a day.

                After a few months, you may find that you feel like a whole new person.

                👉How should I use Slave Brain Wave Extermination?

                ✅ ANSWER: If you are a Slave Brain Wave Extermination customer, you should listen to it at night before going to sleep for it to be more effective.

                If you can’t, you can listen to it at any other time and it will also work, but it will take longer to see the results.

                NOTE: If you have the Billionaire Wave Booster, you can listen to the Slave Brain Wave Extermination right after the Billionaire Wave Booster.
